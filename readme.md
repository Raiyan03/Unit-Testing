# Singly Linked List and Object Serialization in C#

This C# project provides a comprehensive implementation of a singly linked list, alongside serialization and deserialization functionality for User objects. Designed with best practices in mind, this project is developed in Visual Studio and includes a robust suite of unit tests to ensure reliability and performance.

## Features

- **Singly Linked List Implementation**: Efficiently manages a collection of elements with operations for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Implements custom serialization for the User object, enabling easy persistence and retrieval of data.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for linked list operations and object serialization, ensuring code integrity and correctness.
